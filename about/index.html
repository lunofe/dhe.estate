            <!-- Important People's Background -->
            <p>
                The DHE today is under a Constitution led by a Democratic government. Looking back, it's been a major success for the Vampire Hunters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The founding father of the DHE was <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/98105ad8-080a-4d70-a5da-0cc27a833309?q=98105ad8-080a-4d70-a5da-0cc27a833309" target="_blank">ThugPug43</a> <i>("ThugPug")</i>. 5 May, 2019, ThugPug initiated a democratic vote among all Hunters, he himself a candidate. ThugPug won with the vast majority. His first declaration was to add two Vampire Hunter Co-Consuls that could remove the leader to prevent tyranny. Eventually, ThugPug lost time to other business, and unable to dedicate. Later, ThugPug would completely retire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Vampire Hunters now had a centralized leader, Vampires still held rein in popularity and outnumbered the Vampire Hunters by more then <i>ten times</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around May 2019, a Vampire by the name of <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/ce088023-21fa-493a-b080-c8177879bf4f?q=ce088023-21fa-493a-b080-c8177879bf4f" target="_blank">Kranzy</a> has achieved Lordship over Vampires. Shortly after, the Minecraft Gods banished him into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Purgatory&oldid=943656501#Role_in_relation_to_sin" target="_blank">purgatory</a>. Upon his return in late June 2019, a Vampire by the name of <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/ee6af389-e39b-4544-9f1a-1b447acd2cbb?q=ee6af389-e39b-4544-9f1a-1b447acd2cbb" target="_blank">TheLastHyrule</a> attempted to overthrow Kranzy. TheLastHyrule failed miserably.<!-- Kranzy was temporarily banned by the Senior Administration of the Vampirism Server -->
            </p>
            <p>
                Early June 2019, a Human named <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50?q=d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50" target="_blank">xXvPendragonvXx</a> <i>("Pendragon")</i> - during his NewBlood age - intentionally went against the popular Dark Gift of Vampirism, and became a Vampire Hunter. Vampires continuously exaggerated, belied, and offered Vampiris Sanguinare (the poison that converts Humans to Vampires) to him. Pendragon declined each time.
            </p>
            <br><!-- New Section-->
            <p>
                Kranzy and Pendragon fought, committed espionage, and gathered forces against each other in the name of their faction as a whole. Around August 2019, a major skirmish took place on top a hill with a nearby vampire forest. The skirmish included Kranzy, <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/1d408d8c-0818-4a92-9dac-078e7691dbfd?q=1d408d8c-0818-4a92-9dac-078e7691dbfd" target="_blank">XxTomasVxX</a> <i>("Tomas")</i>, both of whom were Vampires; and Pendragon, ThugPug, both of whom were Vampire Hunters. The Vampire Hunters were massively defeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kranzy's rein as Vampire Lord was a tragic one. Kranzy lost many allies both dedicated veterans and swifters. He experienced betrayal such as by TheLastHyrule. Kranzy now leading with only Tomas by his side, he attempted to rebirth popularity for Vampries to attract Vampirism; one such method he used was assisting other Vampires into greater power with his altar and resources, only to find that they too disappeared. Kranzy was employed by the Minecraft Gods to help NewBlood in the world, and found that being employed <i>and</i> having to succumb toward the Sun being paradoxical. Intrigued to learn of Hunterism, Kranzy dedicded to forsaken Vampirism and become a Vampire Hunter.
            </p>

            <p>
                September 2019, Kranzy and Tomas has completely converted to Hunterism and allied with Pendragon. Afterwards, the three held the second election for Vampire Hunter leadership. The election was a success with no opposition. This time period was known as the <a href="../assets/images/second_era_elections.webp" alt="Elections" target="_blank">Second Era of Hunters</a>. Kranzy held Consulship, Pendragon and Tomas both held Co-Consulship. The three made massive gains for Vampire Hunters.

                <p class="tabDouble" style="font-style: italic;">
                    After the takeover the new Government immidately began acting: gathering Vampire Hunters, building military strength, reinforce the Democracy, issuing announcements, and making massive improvements never seen before. The Head of State experienced foriegn espoinage causing Imperator Kranzy to found a well developed Discord for all Hunters to ensure Free Speech, developed Intelligence, and detached every Vampire spy. The DHE Discord was released on 30 November, 2019.

                    On 9 December, 2019, Kranzy and Pendragon decided to collaborate on the creation of the DHE Constitution. Pendragon worked exhilaratingly on the creation. The DHE Constitution was announced and empowered on 26 December, 2019.

                <p class="tabDouble" style="font-style: italic;">
                    The Vampire Hunters developed the most advanced community on the Server and their strength was known throughout. The Minecraft Gods announced the War between Vampires and Vampire Hunters on 29 December, 2019, and the Hunters were more than ready. Kranzy supplied the Vampire Hunters with limitless weapons, armor, and potions. Death to a Vampire Hunter had negligible effects.
                </p>
                <p class="tabDouble" style="font-style: italic;">
                    When the Finale Battle of 2019 came, Vampire Hunters were disappointed that most Vampires failed to appear and little resistance was encountered. The Finale Battle of 2019 marked the Vampire Hunter's rein of Supremacy.

                Server reset of January 2020, the third Vampire Hunter election took place. Once more Kranzy, Pendragon, and Tomas became a candidate party for Hunter leadership. The three candidates were once again without opposition and won the election. This time period was known as the <a href="../assets/images/third_era_elections.webp" alt="Elections" target="_blank">Third Era of Hunters</a>. In this Third Era of Hunters, a formal <a href="../assets/Constitution.pdf" target="_blank">Constitution</a> was made, formal <a href="../empire/index.html" target="_blank">governmental postitions</a> were created, and the founding of the DHE's Capital City: Purtania. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The creation of Purtania happened with Kranzy appealing a deal with the Minecraft Gods to fund the project, in exchange for cash debt. The Minecraft Gods accepted. Kranzy found a rich area befitting of the DHE and laid claim.

                Early March 2020, the DHE is at war with Vampires led by Vampire Lord <a href="https://namemc.com/profile/84b8aa9f-cfc4-4154-abae-37faa82745b5?q=84b8aa9f-cfc4-4154-abae-37faa82745b5" target="_blank">S_olace</a>.
