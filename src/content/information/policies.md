# DHE Policies

*"Policies are local rulings. Policy and policies can be created to outline a
ministry or land to that of rules. Policies must conform with the Constitution
and laws, to be abide to those the policy outlines for." - DHE Constitution*

Policies are governmnet-branch specific outlines for a bureaucracy or
subsystems. The DHE government makes an effort to publicized policies for
transparency.  Policies denoted with [EXECUTIVE] are executive-branch policies,
by the Head of State and not requiring legislative actions.  Policies denoted
with [LEGISLATIVE] are legislative-branch policies, by the High Council and not
requiring referendum actions.

Policies have less requirements and relatively less impacts. Laws have higher
requirements and higher impacts.
