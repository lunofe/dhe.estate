# History of the Hunters and the Democratic Hunter Empire

The DHE today is under a Constitution led by a Democratic government. Looking
back, it's been a major success for the Vampire Hunters.

The founding father of the DHE was
[ThugPug43](https://namemc.com/profile/98105ad8-080a-4d70-a5da-0cc27a833309?q=98105ad8-080a-4d70-a5da-0cc27a833309)
("ThugPug"). 5 May, 2019, ThugPug initiated a democratic vote among all Hunters,
he himself a candidate. ThugPug won with the vast majority. His first
declaration was to add two Vampire Hunter Co-Consuls that could remove the
leader to prevent tyranny. Eventually ThugPug lost time to other business and
unable to dedicate. Later, ThugPug would completely retire.

Although Vampire Hunters now had a centralized leader, Vampires still held rein
in popularity and outnumbered the Vampire Hunters by more then ten times.

Around May 2019, a Vampire by the name of
[Kranzy](https://namemc.com/profile/ce088023-21fa-493a-b080-c8177879bf4f?q=ce088023-21fa-493a-b080-c8177879bf4f)
has achieved Lordship over Vampires. Shortly after the Minecraft Gods banished
him into
[purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Purgatory&oldid=943656501#Role_in_relation_to_sin).
Upon his return in late June 2019, a Vampire by the name of
[TheLastHyrule](https://namemc.com/profile/ee6af389-e39b-4544-9f1a-1b447acd2cbb?q=ee6af389-e39b-4544-9f1a-1b447acd2cbb)
attempted to overthrow Kranzy. TheLastHyrule failed miserably.

Early June 2019, a Human named
[xXvPendragonvXx](https://namemc.com/profile/d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50?q=d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50)
("Pendragon") during his NewBlood age sought Hunterism after living as a Vampire
during his pastlife.

Kranzy and Pendragon fought, committed espionage, and gathered forces against
each other in the name of their major faction. Around August 2019, a significant
skirmish took place on top a hill with a nearby vampire forest. The skirmish
included Kranzy,
[XxTomasVxX](https://namemc.com/profile/1d408d8c-0818-4a92-9dac-078e7691dbfd?q=1d408d8c-0818-4a92-9dac-078e7691dbfd)
("Tomas"), both of whom were Vampires; and Pendragon, ThugPug, both of whom were
Vampire Hunters. The Vampire Hunters were defeated.

Kranzy's rein as Vampire Lord was tragic: losing allies of dedicated veterans
and swifters, experiencing betrayls such as by TheLastHyrule. Kranzy was
employed by the Minecraft Gods to help NewBloods in the world. As a Vampire
suffering the Sun and pursuing to help NewBloods of the World, Kranzy and Tomas
decided to Hunterism with the aid of Pendragon.

September 2019, Kranzy and Tomas has completely converted to Hunterism and
allied with Pendragon. Afterwards, the three held the second election for
Vampire Hunter leadership. The election was a success with no opposition. This
time period was known as the [Second Era of
Hunters](/images/second_era_elections.png). Kranzy held
Consulship, Pendragon and Tomas both held Co-Consulship. The three made massive
gains for Vampire Hunters:

After the takeover the new Government immidately began acting: gathering
Vampire Hunters, building military strength, reinforce the Democracy, issuing
announcements, and making radical improvements. The Head of State experienced
foreign espionage causing the DHE government to found a well developed Discord
for all Hunters to ensure Free Speech, developed Intelligence, and purge all
Vampire spies. The DHE Discord was released on 30 November, 2019.

{{< h/3/indent 10 >}} The final step towards full Democracy: The Constitution.
{{< /h/3/indent >}}

{{< p/indent 10 >}} On 9 December, 2019, Kranzy and Pendragon collaborated on
the creation of the DHE Constitution. Pendragon worked exhilaratingly on the
creation. The DHE Constitution was announced and empowered on 26 December,
2019.  {{< /p/indent >}}

{{< h/3/indent 10 >}} The Finale Battle of 2019.  {{< /h/3/indent >}}

{{< p/indent 10 >}} The DHE's strength was known throughout. The Minecraft Gods
announced the War between Vampires and Vampire Hunters on 29 December, 2019,
and the Vampire Hunters were ready. Kranzy supplied the Vampire Hunters with
limitless weapons, armor, and potions. Death to a Vampire Hunter had negligible
effects.  {{< /p/indent >}}


{{< p/indent 10 >}} When the Finale Battle of 2019 came, Vampire Hunters were
disappointed that most Vampires failed to appear and little resistance was
encountered. The Finale Battle of 2019 marked the Vampire Hunter's reign of
Supremacy.  {{< /p/indent >}}


Server reset of January 2020, the third Vampire Hunter election took place.
Kranzy, Pendragon, and Tomas once again became a candidate party for DHE
leadership. The three candidates were without opposition and won the election.
This time period was known as the Third Era of Hunters. In this [Third Era of
Hunters](/images/third_era_elections.png), a formal
[Constitution](/pdf/constitution.pdf) was made, formal [governmental
positions](/about/empire.html) were created, and the founding of the DHE's
Capital City: Purtania.

Early March 2020, the DHE is at war with Vampires led by Vampire Lord
[S_olace](https://namemc.com/profile/84b8aa9f-cfc4-4154-abae-37faa82745b5).
The Vampires are cowering and Vampire Hunters have grown immensely, and continue
to grow. [And you can be part of it](/).

2020 May 4, the DHE National day, held an event hunting multiple Wither
Skeletons simultaneously. The Minecraft Gods blessed this day with an company
of additional Whither Skeletons and an Ender Dragon who the soldiers of
Purtania fought against in defense of Purtanian infrastructure; the Ender
Dragon partially destroyed buildings before being slain. As dusk struck the
night sky was ablazed with fireworks.

2020 May 31, the Battle for the Ender Dragon's Egg between the DHE and the
Vampire Empire was won by a third party group called the [White
Lotus](/information/foreign-affairs/#white_lotus). Later, White Lotus donated
the Ender Dragon's Egg to the Vampire Empire.

2021 January 6,
[Saxtreme](https://namemc.com/profile/7a02cdd6-a3c2-4ed9-b321-9ddab2aa77ac) was
elected Imperator along side

and [SoapyTrait](https://namemc.com/profile/622c377d-067c-4a57-8a5d-97c93b3941b9)
as Consuls through the first formal peaceful transition of power.
