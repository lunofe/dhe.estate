# [Proclamations](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proclamation&oldid=920900945) for foreigners by the Democratic Hunter Empire.

### Monroe Doctrine

Any foreign group/government/community what interferes into Hunter's politics,
claims, and/or economy without DHE's approval will be seen as a Declaration of
War.

### Appropriation Doctrine

The Democratic Hunter Empire is the father of all Hunters and Hunter
communities. The Democratic Hunter Empire represents all Hunters where each
Hunter may declare themselves nationless or become a DHE citizen.
