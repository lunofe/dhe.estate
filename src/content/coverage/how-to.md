### Fixing common problems:

- Almost everything about the Vampirism Mod can be found within the
  Vampirism Guide book which can be crafted with a normal book and a
  Vampire Fang. If the Vampirism Guide book cannot be found/crafted
  then make sure that the GuideAPI mod is installed.
- Crafting recipes not found in the Just Enough Items (JEI) mod or
  similar mods can alternatively be found within the Vampirism Guide
  book.
- A lot of problems arise from conflicting or unknown keybinds set by
  pre-made modpacks or personal configurations. Check the keybindings
  for whatever you are attempting to do such as V for sucking blood as
  a Vampire.
- Sucking blood requires pressing and holding down the suck-blood key
  (default is V). Sucking blood is not instant.

Check out the official Vampirism Wiki page for problem-solutions.

### Getting Vampire Blood:

Killing a Vampire NPC with a Stake is the traditional method of getting Vampire
Blood. Only the final hit has to be with a Stake so the first few hits may be
done with a sword. Advanced Vampires (named Vampires) have a passive chance of
dropping Vampire Blood without the need of a Stake. Hunter Expert villagers may
offer Vampire Blood as a trade.

### Using the blood container:

Right clicking a filled Blood Bottle onto a Blood Container will deposit the
blood from the bottle to the Blood Container. Shift-right clicking will
withdraw blood. Vampires can directly suck blood from Blood Containers.

### Using the Blood Grinder:

The Blood Grinder inputs raw meat items such as raw beef and raw pork then
output those as impure blood. Taking the impure blood and inputing that into a
Blood Sieve will output normal and drinkable blood. This can be automated by
putting (from top to bottom) a chest, hopper, Blood Grinder, Blood Sieve, then
a Blood Container at the bottom to collect the blood.

### Removing Sanguinare Vampiris:

Vampiris Sanguinare is an effect that Humans contract when consuming a Vampire
Fang, being hit by a Vampire NPC, or being bit from behind by a Vampire player.
Vampiris Sanguinare converts a Human to a Vampire over an amount of time.

Dying, drinking milk, or eatting garlic bread will remove Sanguinare Vampiris.

### Making Pure Salt and Blessed Salt:

Pure Salt and Blessed Salt can only be crafted by Hunters. The Hunter skill
Basic Alchemy is required. Pure Salt and Blessed Salt can also be found in loot
chests.

Craft and place down an Alchemical Caldron. It's recommended to place down
multiple as the brewing takes more than the average brewing time for MC Vanilla
items.

Fuel the Alchemical Cauldron with coal and input a bucket of water. Over time
the Alchemical Cauldron will output 4 Pure Salt and an empty bucket. Pure Salt
alone isn't useful, right clicking an Altar Of Cleansing will convert all the
Pure Salt that's being held into Blessed Salt.

### Making Holy Water:

Holy Water can only be crafted by Hunters. Enhanced Holy Water requires the
Enhanced Holy Water skill purchase and has the same method of crafting as
normal Holy Water. Special Holy Water can not be crafted but can be found in
loot chests.

Make Blessed Salt. Open a brewing stand fueled with blaze powder and input
bottles of water and Blessed Salt which will output Blessed Salt Water. Convert
the Blessed Salt Water to Holy Water by right clicking the Blessed Salt Water
onto an Altar of Cleansing. Additionally, convert the Holy Water to a Slash
version by inputing the Holy Water and gun powder into a brewing stand.

### Getting Vampire Books:

Vampire books are primarily used for leveling up as a Hunter or Vampire.
Vampire Books comes from Vampire dungeons which spawn similarily as Vanilla MC
mod spawner dungeons. Killing Advanced (named) Hunters/Vampires has a 5% (1/20)
chance of dropping Vampire Books. Multiplayer servers might have an economy
shop that will offer Vampire Books.

### Binding Actions & Changing Facial Features:

**Binding Actions**

Two action-keybindings can be done. The Keybindings are found in Options >
Controls > Vampirism > Toggle Action. The command for binding-actions is:

	/vampirism bind-action <1/2> vampirism:

An example of binding the Vampire's skill Bat-mode to the keybind 1 would look
like:

	/vampirism bind-action 1 vampirism:bat

In most cases if you are not sure what the exact command is, you may click the
TAB key on the keyboard to autocomplete a command.

**Facial Features**

The command for changing the appearence of the Vampire Fang is:

	/vampirism fang <0-6>

Choosing Six will remove the Vampire Fang.

The command for changing the appearence of the Vampire Eyes is:

	/vampirism eye <0-15>

Choosing Fifteen will remove the Vampire Eyes.
