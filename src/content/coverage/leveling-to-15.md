# How to level up to level 15

Level 15 is an Easter Egg addition available only for Vampirism on MC 1.12;
Continuing to read this means you are okay with spoilers.

## Starting

- You must already be level 14. Craft the Vampirism Guide book on how to do so.
- Find and give a Vampire Book to a level 5 Vampire Baron. The Baron becomes
  level 6 then kill the Baron. You now have Purity 6/5 Blood.
- Go to the End Dimension and get End Stone then turn them into End Stone
  Bricks.

### As A Hunter

- Craft and wear a Hunter Hat.
- Open a crafting table and put the items as if crafting a normal Hunter
  Research Table but do not actually craft it.
- Replace the wood with End Stone Brick and the garlic with an Eye of Ender.
  You now have a "Strange Hunter Research Table." [Craft and place it
  down](/image/strange_hunter_table_craft_1.png).
- Open the Strange Hunter Research Table and input the requirements.
- While still wearing the Hunter Hat go to a Vampire Hunter Trainer and input
  the Trainer's requirements.

Congratulations, you did it.

### As A Vampire

- Craft and wear a Vampire Cloak.
- Go to your ritual area that you use to level up. Replace the gold blocks
  within the pillars to End Stone Bricks (from [gold to End Stone
  Bricks](/image/level_15_vamp_ritual.png)).
- While still wearing a Vampire Cloak go to your ritual area and right click
  the Altar of Infusion block (make sure your holding an item) and input the
  requirements, which should include Purity 6/5 Blood, 64 Human Hearts, and a
  Vampire Book.
- Now right click the altar while holding no items in your hand. Do this during
  ingame night time.

Congratulations, you did it.

## Bonus:

- The Altar of Infusion may output "cannot do [something] for [reason]." In
  some cases this is normal and can safely be ignored.
- Strange Hunter Research Table:
	- `/give @p vampirism:hunter_table2`
- Purity 6/5 Blood:
	- `/give @p vampirism:pure_blood 1 5`
