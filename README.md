# Welcome to the web archive of the Democratic Hunter Empire.
The Democratic Hunter Empire (DHE), also formerly known as the Hunter's Empire, was a prominent faction on [Vampirism.co](https://vampirism.co), characterized by its democratic governance and dedication for vampire hunting.

It was active from May 2019 until the end of 2021 and played a significant role in the server's storyline and community interactions at that time.

Meanwhile, the DHE had two websites, both created and maintained by Pendragon. Their individual domains have since expired, but they can still be viewed through this archive:
- [Modern Website (Until 2022)](https://vampirism.co/dhe/modern)
- [Legacy Website (Until circa March 2020)](https://vampirism.co/dhe/legacy)
