# Development

Wrap lines at 80 characters.

When deploying a local server for testing it is advised to disable the browser's
cache. For Firefox user: open Developer Tools, open the Network tab, enable the
*Disable Cache* option.

Within the `layout/shortcodes/p` the `p` is a HTML `<p>`. Follow this pattern.

`<br>` tags must be on their own lines, not appended to the end of an existing
line.

# A note on copyright from SVG images

Some .svg images from openclipart.org do not display their copyright status or
license on the webpage; nonetheless, the svg files are also text files that can
be opened as such. Open the svg as a text file (either in the browser directly
from openclipart.org or from this repository), scroll down, a
machine-/human- readable copyright status is displayed.
